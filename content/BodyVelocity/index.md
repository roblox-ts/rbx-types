The BodyVelocity object applies a [force][1] on a `BasePart` such that it will maintain a constant velocity. The [BodyVelocity.Velocity](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BodyVelocity/Velocity) property, not to be confused wtih [BasePart.Velocity](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BasePart/Velocity), controls the goal velocity. This is the translational counterpart to a `BodyAngularVelocity`. If you need the part to move toward a goal position, use a `BodyPosition` instead. If you need further control on a force applied to an object, consider using a `BodyForce` or `BodyThrust` instead.

The strength of the force applied by this object is controlled by several factors, namely the difference between the part's current velocity and the goal velocity. This is multiplied by [P](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BodyVelocity/P) (power) to either amplify or diminish it. The resulting force is then capped by [MaxForce](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BodyVelocity/MaxForce). By setting [BodyVelocity.Velocity](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BodyVelocity/Velocity) to `(0, 0, 0)` it is possible to simulate [Anchored](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BasePart/Anchored) behavior with less strictness.
