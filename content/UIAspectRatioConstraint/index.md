A UIAspectRatioConstraint ensures that the parent UI element (`GuiObject`) maintains a particular aspect ratio even if its size is set as a percentage of its parent. If an object with this constraint is also under the control of a `UILayout` such as `UIGridLayout`, then the constraint controls the objects size and overwrites any size the layout would apply.

When applied to a GuiObject, the UIAspectRatioConstraint will make sure that the objects ratio is maintained by the value defined in [UIAspectRatioConstraint.AspectRatio](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/UIAspectRatioConstraint/AspectRatio). The [UIAspectRatioConstraint.AspectType](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/UIAspectRatioConstraint/AspectType) sets what determines the maximum size of the object. When set to [UIAspectRatioConstraint.FitWithinMaxSize](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=FitWithinMaxSize), the constraint will make the object the maximum size it can be within the `/GuiObject` of the element. When set to ScaleWithParentSize, the elements maximum size will be the size of the parent while still maintaining the aspect ratio. Finally, the [UIAspectRatioConstraint.DominantAxis](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/UIAspectRatioConstraint/DominantAxis) will determine which axis to use when setting the new size of the element.
