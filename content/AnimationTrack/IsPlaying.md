A read only property that returns true when the `AnimationTrack` is playing.

This property can be used by developers to check if an animation is already playing before playing it (as that would cause it to restart). If a developer wishes to obtain all playing `AnimationTrack`s on a `Humanoid` or `AnimationController` they should use [Humanoid.GetPlayingAnimationTracks](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Humanoid/GetPlayingAnimationTracks)
