Returns the position in time in seconds that an `AnimationTrack` is through playing its source animation. Can be set to make the track jump to a specific moment in the animation.

TimePosition can be set to go to a specific point in the animation, but the `AnimationTrack` must be playing to do so. It can also be used in combination with [AnimationTrack.AdjustSpeed](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/AnimationTrack/AdjustSpeed) to freeze the animation at a desired point (by setting speed to 0).
