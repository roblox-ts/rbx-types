Determines whether outlines are enabled or disabled in a place.

Outlines can be disabled on a global basis, using this `Lighting` property, or alternatively on a surface-by-surface basis for `BasePart`s using [Enum.SurfaceType](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=SurfaceType).

Although this property can be set by scripts, it recommended this property is set in Roblox Studio prior to publishing the place.

Note, although outlines are not deprecated they are not the default and may no longer be supported in the future.

For more information on changing outlines, please see this [blog post][1].
