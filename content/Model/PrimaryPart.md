Points to the `Model`'s primary part. The part is the `BasePart` that is used as a basis when positioning the model using the [Model.MoveTo](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Model/MoveTo) and [Model.SetPrimaryPartCFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Model/SetPrimaryPartCFrame) functions.

Note when assigning the PrimaryPart that the part must be a `BasePart` that is descendant of the Model. If this is not the case, the PrimaryPart will be set to nil in Roblox studio, or produce an error if done so by a Script.

When dealing with models full of unanchored parts connected with joints such as `Weld`s or `Motor6D`s it is best practice to set the PrimaryPart to the root part of the assembly. Giving the example of a Player Character, this is the HumanoidRootPart.
