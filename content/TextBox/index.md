A GUI object which allows you to type within its boundaries.

TextBox is specifically meant for user input.

Unlike `TextLabel`, TextBoxes will not be translated by `LocalizationService` because it's text is assumed to be user input. For a text field that is not meant for user input `TextLabel` should be used.
