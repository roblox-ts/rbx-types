A CoreScript is a special type of script, that cannot be edited or ran by normal users. They are used by Roblox to handle integrated user interfaces found in the `CoreGui` among other things.

CoreScripts are special, because they can use API that is under the RobloxScriptSecurity security level.

You can find Roblox's built-in CoreScripts in their [github repository](https://github.com/ROBLOX/Core-Scripts/tree/master/CoreScriptsRoot).

They can also be found and modified from Roblox Studio's content folder (which is located in the directory folder of Roblox Studio's executable) via [content.scripts](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=scripts).
