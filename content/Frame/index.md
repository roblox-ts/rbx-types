Frame is a `GuiObject` that renders as a plain rectangle with no other content. They are the simplest concrete example of a `GuiObject`, as they provide very little additional functionality (`Frame.FrameStyle`). Despite this, Frames are useful as containers for other `GuiObject`s, such as `TextLabel`, `ImageLabel`. The key benefit to using a Frame over a `Folder` as a container object is the ability to further manipulate the `GuiObject.Size` and `GuiObject.Position` of any descendant `GuiObject`s.
