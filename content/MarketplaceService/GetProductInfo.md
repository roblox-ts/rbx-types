\* See [Asset Types](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=Asset-types) for the asset type ID numbers. â€ Timestamps are formatted using [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)

## Developer Product Example

The following example loads information about a developer product.

```lua
local PRODUCT_ID = 336755544

local MarketplaceService = game:GetService("MarketplaceService")

local productInfo = MarketplaceService:GetProductInfo(PRODUCT_ID, Enum.InfoType.Product)

print("Product ID " .. PRODUCT_ID .. " name: " .. productInfo.Name) 

if productInfo.Description then
	print("Description: " .. productInfo.Description)
else
	print("No description!")
end

if productInfo.IsForSale then
	print("It is on sale for " .. productInfo.PriceInRobux .. " Robux.")
end

print("The image icon is: rbxassetid://" .. productInfo.IconImageAssetId)
```

## Use in Studio Plugins

This method is often used by plugins to detect old versions and notify the user to manually update a plugin. The plugin author uploads a dummy asset, such as a decal or model, then puts the present version of the plugin in that asset's description. The plugin then calls this method and checks an internal version number for a newer version.

## Possible Errors

If no such item exists with the given ID, this function will throw an error:

 - For developer products, the error is:

> *MarketplaceService:getProductInfo() failed because rawProductInfo was empty*

 - For game passes and assets, the error is:

> *MarketplaceService:getProductInfo() failed because HTTP 0 (HTTP 400 (HTTP/1.1 400 BadRequest))*
