Breaks all joints between the specified `BasePart`s and other `BasePart`s.

This function requires an array of `BasePart`s. Note, joints will not be broken between these `BasePart`s (each other), only between these `BasePart`s and other `BasePart`s not in the array.

This function is used by the Roblox Studio Move tool when the user starts moving a selection. In conjunction with [Plugin.GetJoinMode](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Plugin/GetJoinMode) and [Workspace.JoinToOutsiders](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Workspace/JoinToOutsiders) it can be used to retain join functionality when developing custom studio build tools. See the snippets below for an example.

```lua
-- finished moving a selection, make joints
local function finishedMovingParts(parts)
	local joinMode = Plugin:GetJoinMode()
	workspace:JoinToOutsiders(parts, joinMode)
end
```
	 *
```lua
-- started moving a selection, break joints
local function startMovingParts(parts)
	workspace:UnjoinFromOutsiders(parts)
end
```

Developers interested in seeing how this function is used in the Roblox Studio should see the [Studio Tools GitHub repository][1].
