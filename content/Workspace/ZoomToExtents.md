Positions and zooms the [Workspace.CurrentCamera](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Workspace/CurrentCamera) to show the extent of `BasePart`s currently in the `Workspace`.

This function was used in the, now removed, 'Zoom To Extents' button in Roblox Studio. It exhibits similar behavior to the 'Zoom To' (F shortcut) feature, however it shows the extents of the `Workspace` rather than the currently selected object.

This function cannot be used in scripts but will function in the command bar or plugins.
