A [GUI](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/GuiObject) that can display children 3D objects inside its viewport. Children objects will not be rendered in the main scene. Background color is transparent.

This is a great way to display 3D objects/models in a 2D&nbsp;GUI space like a `ScreenGui`.

### Caveats

  - Currently 3D objects can only be displayed on [ScreenGuis](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/ScreenGui) or [PluginGuis](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/PluginGui)

  - Objects inside ViewportFrames are rendered using a fixed [lighting](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/Lighting) setting

  - No shadow or post effects are available. Neon and Glass [materials](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=Material) will be rendered on lowest quality

### Using ViewportFrames

#### Through Studio UI

 1. Add a ViewportFrame into a [GuiLayerCollector](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/LayerCollector), such as a ScreenGui or `SurfaceGui`. This will cause a blank UI element to appear in the main window.

 2. Add a model that you want to show in the ViewportFrame into `Workspace`. Target your camera towards the [model](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/Model).

 3. Set [ViewportFrame.CurrentCamera](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/ViewportFrame/CurrentCamera) to Workspace.Camera. Drag the model into the ViewportFrame. The model should show up there.

 4. You can change the size, position or other properties of ViewportFrame like other GUIs. Now the CurrentCamera is a reference to the main camera in Workspace, so if you move the camera in the main scene, it will also affect ViewportFrame. When you find a good position, duplicate the camera and make sure it is not the one Workspace is using. Then set it to ViewportFrame.CurrentCamera so the camera wonâ€™t be changed by Workspace operations.

#### Through Scripts

You can also set up a ViewportFrame using scripts. Add the following `LocalScript` into a ScreenGui (or other proper Guis), run the game and you will get a [Part](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/BasePart) rendered inside a ViewportFrame.

```lua
local vf = Instance.new("ViewportFrame", script.Parent)
vf.Size = UDim2.new(0.5, 0, 0.5, 0)
vf.Position = UDim2.new(0.25, 0, 0.25, 0)
vf.BackgroundColor3 = Color3.new(1, 1, 1)

local part = Instance.new("Part", vf)
part.Position = Vector3.new(0, 0, 0)

local camera = Instance.new("Camera", vf)
vf.CurrentCamera = camera

local cameraPosition = Vector3.new(3, 3, 3)
camera.CFrame = CFrame.new(cameraPosition, part.Position)
```
