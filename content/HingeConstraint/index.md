A hinge allows two Attachments to rotate about one axis. A HingeConstraint constrains its two attachments so that they both occupy the same position and that their x-axes point in the same direction. The constraint allows the attachments to rotate about their x-axes.

Hinges can also be configured to actuate rotation. If [HingeConstraint.ActuatorType](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/HingeConstraint/ActuatorType) is set to [Motor](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=ActuatorType), then the hinge will attempt to rotate the attachments with the goal of reaching [HingeConstraint.AngularVelocity](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/HingeConstraint/AngularVelocity). This rotation is limited by both [HingeConstraint.MotorMaxAcceleration](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/HingeConstraint/MotorMaxAcceleration) and [HingeConstraint.MotorMaxTorque](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/HingeConstraint/MotorMaxTorque).

If ActuatorType is set to [Servo](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=ActuatorType), then the hinge will attempt to rotate to an angle specified by [HingeConstraint.TargetAngle](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/HingeConstraint/TargetAngle). This rotation is limited by both [HingeConstraint.AngularSpeed](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/HingeConstraint/AngularSpeed) and [HingeConstraint.ServoMaxTorque](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/HingeConstraint/ServoMaxTorque).

Both actuated and free spinning rotation using a HingeConstraint can be limited by setting [HingeConstraint.LimitsEnabled](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/HingeConstraint/LimitsEnabled) to `true`.
