The Shape property sets the type of shape the object has.

The [Enum.PartType](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=PartType) enum controls the shape value, and has three possible shapes:

| Shape/Value | Description                           |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| Ball        | A spherical shape, like a basketball. |
| Cylinder    | A rod-like shape, like a tin can.     |
| Block       | The default, brick shape.             |

To obtain custom part shapes, you can use a `MeshPart` instead of a `Part`.
