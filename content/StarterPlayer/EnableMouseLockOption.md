The EnableMouseLockOption `StarterPlayer` property determines if a player can toggle mouse lock by default.

Mouselock will lock the player's cursor to the center of the screen. Moving the mouse will rotate the `Camera` and `Player` will move relative to the current rotation of the camera.

This property sets the value of [Player.DevEnableMouseLock](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Player/DevEnableMouseLock).
