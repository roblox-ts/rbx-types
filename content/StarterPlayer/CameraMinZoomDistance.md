The CameraMinZoonDistance `StarterPlayer` property sets the minimum distance in studs the camera can be from the character with the default cameras.

This property sets the default value of [Player.CameraMinZoomDistance](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Player/CameraMinZoomDistance) for each player who joins the game. If this value is set to a higher value than [StarterPlayer.CameraMaxZoomDistance](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/StarterPlayer/CameraMaxZoomDistance) it will be decreased to CameraMaxZoomDistance.
