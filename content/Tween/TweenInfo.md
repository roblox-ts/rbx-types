Read-only property that includes information on how the interpolation of the `Tween` is to be carried out, using the `TweenInfo` data type. The TweenInfo data type includes a range of properties that can be used to achieve various styles of animation, including reversing and looping `Tween`s (see examples).

As with all `Tween` properties, the TweenInfo property is read only. If a developer wants to modify the TweenInfo of a Tween they must create a new `Tween` using [TweenService.Create](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/TweenService/Create).
