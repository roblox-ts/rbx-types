Threshold determines how bright a color can be before it blooms. By default, this value is 0.95, which means that a pixel's color must have a lightness of 95% in order to bloom. If set to 1, only pure white colors will bloom. Conversely, if you set this to 0 all colors will bloom.  In Studio, the slider is bound to [0.8, 1]; however, values in the range [0, 1] are valid too. Values outside of this range have undefined behavior.
