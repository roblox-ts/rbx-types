Size determines the radius of the bloom effect in pixels in a similar manner to [BlurEffect.Size](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BlurEffect/Size). Larger values create a wider bloom effect, and a value of 0 will disable the bleed (but not the color adjustment). By default, this value is 24. Although this property can be set to any float, only values in the range [0, 56] produce change. Values outside of this range have undefined behavior.
