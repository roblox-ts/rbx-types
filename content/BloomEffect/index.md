The BloomEffect creates the effect of a camera viewing very bright light. It causes brighter colors to glow, similar to applying the Neon [Material](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BasePart/Material) to everything, including the the `Sky`. Multiple BloomEffect objects can be used at the same time; doing so can further strengthen the result. Like other post-processing effects, objects of this type will only work while [Enabled](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/PostEffect/Enabled) and when parented to `Lighting` or the [Workspace.CurrentCamera](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Workspace/CurrentCamera).

The render behavior may also change or **disable completely** depending on the [EditQualityLevel](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/RenderSettings/EditQualityLevel) (in Studio) or the [QualityLevel](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/RenderSettings/QualityLevel). If you don't see BloomEffect rendering, check Roblox's settings. If set to Automatic, Roblox may choose a lower quality level which isn't high enough to render BloomEffect. You can override this manually: In Studio, at Level07 and below, BloomEffect does not render at all. At Level08 through Level11 a simple algorithm is used, and at Level12 and above the default behavior is used.
