Intensity determines how intensely the colors that bloom (as determined by the [Threshold](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BloomEffect/Threshold)) will additively blend with themselves. Higher values will produce brighter colors. By default, this value is 0.4. In Studio, this property can be set on the range [0, 1], though any value in the range [0, 4] will produce change. Values outside of this range have undefined behavior.
