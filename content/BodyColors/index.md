BodyColors is a utility object used by Roblox to load avatar body colors from the website.

Avatars that are loaded from the website will automatically have a BodyColors object corresponding to said avatar's body color configuration.

When parented inside of a character with a `Humanoid`, it will apply the colors to each specified limb.
