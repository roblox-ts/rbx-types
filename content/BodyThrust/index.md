The BodyThrust object applies (or exerts) a force relative to the part to which it is parented at a specific location. It behaves similar to a `BodyForce`, except that this object's force applies at a specific point ([BodyThrust.Location](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BodyThrust/Location)), allowing you to exert a [torque][1] (rotational force). To apply a force dynamically so that a part maintains a constant angular velocity, use a `BodyAngularVelocity` instead. To apply a force dynamically so that a part maintains a constant orientation (angular position), use a `BodyGyro`.
