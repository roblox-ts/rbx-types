The NearPlaneZ property describes how far away the Cameraâ€™s near clipping plane is in studs. The near clipping plane is a geometric plane that sits in-front of the [Camera's](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/Camera) [Camera.CFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Camera/CFrame). Anything between this plane and the camera will not render. This creates a cutaway view when viewing objects at very short distances. See the images below for a visual example of this:

The value of NearPlaneZ varies across different platforms, but is currently always between *-0.1* and *-0.5*.

 - Most windows systems, all Xbox systems and most iOS systems support the more precise value of *-0.1*

 - Currently Mac and Android systems only support a NearPlaneZ of *-0.5*, although this may change in the future
