This  property determines the size of the flame particles. It must be in the range of [2, 30]. Unlike [ParticleEmitter.Size](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/Size), the actual size of the flames will not match 1-to-1 with the equivalent size in studs; it is somewhat smaller.

![Two torches - the left has Size = 5 and the right has Size = 10][1]

To make your environment more cohesive, try adding a `PointLight` as a sibling to the `Fire` object. Set the [PointLight.Brightness](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=Brightness) and [PointLight.Range](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/PointLight/Range) proportional to this property so that larger flames produce more light.
