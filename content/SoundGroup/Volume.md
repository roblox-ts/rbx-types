The volume multiplier applied to `Sound`s that are in the `SoundGroup`. This value ranges from 0 to 10.

This property acts as a multiplier, and thus sounds in a `SoundGroup` will retain their relative volumes when it is set. This means if a sound's [Sound.Volume](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Sound/Volume) is 0.5 and it is assigned to a `SoundGroup` with a volume of 0.5, its effective volume will be 0.25.
