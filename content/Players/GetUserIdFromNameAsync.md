This function will send a query to the Roblox website asking what the [Player.UserId](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Player/UserId) is of the account with the given `Player` name. This function **does not cache**; it always sends a web request even if a username was already queried or if the player is already connected to the server (and thus has their UserId exposed).

This method errors if no account exists with the given username. If you aren't certain such an account exists, it's recommended to wrap calls to this function with `pcall`. In addition, you can manually cache results to quickly make future calls with the same username. See the code samples to learn how to do this.
@param userName The **username** of the player being specified
@returns The `Player/UserId` of a user whose name is specified
