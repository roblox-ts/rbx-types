Indicates whether or not classic chat is enabled. This property is set by the [Players.SetChatStyle](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Players/SetChatStyle) method using the [Enum.ChatStyle](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=ChatStyle) enum.

When this chat mode is enabled, the game displays chats in a bubble above the sender's head.

There are two other chat modes, [Players.BubbleChat](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Players/BubbleChat) and a chat mode where both classic and bubble chat are enabled.
