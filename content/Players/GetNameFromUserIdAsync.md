The GetNameFromUserIdAsync `Players` function will send a query to the Roblox website asking what the username is of the account with the given [UserId](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Player/UserId). This function **does not cache**; it always sends a web request even if a UserId was already queried or if the player is already connected to the server (and thus has their username exposed).

This method errors if no account exists with the given UserId. If you aren't certain such an account exists, it's recommended to wrap calls to this function with `pcall`. In addition, you can manually cache results to make future calls with the same UserId fast. See the code samples to learn how to do this.
@param userId The **userId** of the player being specified.
@returns The name of a user with the specified **userId**.
