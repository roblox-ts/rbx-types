The Color property determines the color of all the particles emit by a `Sparkles` object (both existing and future particles). It behaves similarly to [ParticleEmitter.Color](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/Color), except that it is only one color and not a [DataType.ColorSequence](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=ColorSequence). Sparkles have a natural color sequence applied which is most apparent when this property is set to white; sparkles very faintly animate between a subtle green and red. Below, you can see two `Sparkles` objects with differing SparkleColor (the left is default, the right is white).

![Two Sparkles objects with differing SparkleColor][1]

It should be noted that sparkles have a partial [ParticleEmitter.LightEmission](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/LightEmission) effect, so dark colors tend to render more transparent and white colors look very bright.

This property functions identically to [Sparkles.SparkleColor](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Sparkles/SparkleColor).
