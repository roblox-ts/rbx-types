The Neutral property determines whether the player is on a specific team.

* When *true*, the player is not on a specific team. This also means that the [Player.Team](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Player/Team) property will be nil and the [Player.TeamColor](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Player/TeamColor) will be white.

* When *false*, the player is on a specific team. The [Player.Team](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Player/Team) property will correspond to the `Team` that the player is on, as will the [Player.TeamColor](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Player/TeamColor).
