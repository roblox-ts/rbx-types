The LocaleId `Player` property shows the locale id that the local player has set for their Roblox account. It holds a string with the two letter code (for example, "en-us") for the locale.

This can be used to determine the geographic demographic of your game's player base.

The property is similar to `LocalizationService`'s [LocalizationService.RobloxLocaleId](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/LocalizationService/RobloxLocaleId) property.
