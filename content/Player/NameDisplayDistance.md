The NameDisplayDistance `StarterPlayer` property sets the distance in studs at which this player will see other `Humanoid`â€™s names. If the property is set to 0, names are hidden. This property is set to [StarterPlayer.NameDisplayDistance](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/StarterPlayer/NameDisplayDistance) by default.

## Note

If a Humanoid's health bar is visible, you can set the display type using [Humanoid.DisplayDistanceType](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Humanoid/DisplayDistanceType).
