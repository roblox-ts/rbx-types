The Team property is a reference to a `Team` object within the `Teams` service. It determines the team the player is on; if the `Player` isn't on a team or has an invalid [Player.TeamColor](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Player/TeamColor), this property is nil. When this property is set, the player has joined the `Team` and the [Team.PlayerAdded](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/Team/PlayerAdded) event fires on the associated team. Similarly, [Team.PlayerRemoved](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/Team/PlayerRemoved) fires when the property is unset from a certain `Team`.
