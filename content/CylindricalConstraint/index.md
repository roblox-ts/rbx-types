A CylindricalConstraint allows its `Attachment` to slide along an axis and rotate about another axis. It can be thought of like a combination of a `PrismaticConstraint` and a `HingeConstraint`. The sliding axis is determined by the x axis of the constraint's [Constraint.Attachment0](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Constraint/Attachment0). The rotation axis is centered at the constraint's [Constraint.Attachment1](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Constraint/Attachment1) and is angled off of the sliding constraint by the constraint's [CylindricalConstraint.InclinationAngle](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/CylindricalConstraint/InclinationAngle).

This constraint, along with a `SpringConstraint`, is ideal for building vehicle suspension.
