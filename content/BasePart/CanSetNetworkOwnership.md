The CanSetNetworkOwnership function checks whether you can set a [part's](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/BasePart) network ownership.

The functionâ€™s return value verifies whether or not you can call [BasePart.SetNetworkOwner](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/BasePart/SetNetworkOwner) or [BasePart.SetNetworkOwnershipAuto](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/BasePart/SetNetworkOwnershipAuto) without encountering an error. It returns true if you can modify/read the network ownership, or returns false and the reason you can't, as a string.
