This property determines whether or not the visual effect of an `Explosion` is shown or not.

When Visible is set to false, the explosion will still affect `BasePart`s in its [Explosion.BlastRadius](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Explosion/BlastRadius), the only difference is it will not be seen.

One use for this property would be for a developer to make their own custom explosion effects using a `ParticleEmitter`, whilst retaining the default `Explosion` functionality.
