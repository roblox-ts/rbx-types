BlurEffect will apply a [Gaussian blur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur) to the image of the world rendered by Roblox. The strength of the blur is controlled by the [BlurEffect.Size](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BlurEffect/Size). Only one BlurEffect can be applied at once â€” the BlurEffect with the greatest Size takes priority. Like other [post-processing effects](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/PostEffect), objects of this kind will only work when [Enabled](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/PostEffect/Enabled) and parented to the `Lighting` or [Workspace.CurrentCamera](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Workspace/CurrentCamera).

Note: on some low-end devices, BlurEffect may not render for performance. Keep this in mind when using this effect for mobile games.
