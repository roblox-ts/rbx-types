The GuiService is a service which currently allows developers to control what `GuiObject` is currently being selected by the gamepad navigator. It also allows clients to check if Roblox's main menu is currently open.

This service has a lot of hidden members, which are mainly used internally by Roblox's [CoreScripts](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/CoreScript).
