This function adds a `KeyframeMarker` to the `Keyframe` by parenting it to the keyframe. It is functionally identical to setting the markerâ€™s [Instance.Parent](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Instance/Parent) to the Keyframe.

Note, this function will not error when an instance other than a KeyframeMarker is given as the parameter and will parent it successfully.

## More about Keyframes

`Keyframe` names do not need to be unique. For example, if an Animation has three keyframes named "Particles" the connected event returned by [AnimationTrack.GetMarkerReachedSignal](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/AnimationTrack/GetMarkerReachedSignal) will fire each time one of these keyframes is reached.

`Keyframe` names can be set in the Roblox Animation Editor when creating or editing an animation. They cannot however be set by a `Script` on an existing animation prior to playing it.
