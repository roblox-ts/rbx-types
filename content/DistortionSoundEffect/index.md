A distortion effect is used to simulate the effect that would occur when overdriving older style audio equipment (such as vaccuum tubes). This effect causes clipping in the sound and adds a general “fuzzyness”.

Like all other `SoundEffect`, a DistortionSoundEffect can be applied either to a `Sound` or `SoundGroup` by being parented to either.
