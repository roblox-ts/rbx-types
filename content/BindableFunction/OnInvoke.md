This callback can be set multiple times, but cannot be called directly. It is called when the [BindableFunction.Invoke](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/BindableFunction/Invoke) method is called, using the same arguments as parameters.

There are limitations on the valid parameters this callback can return (see the code samples to learn more).
