A PrismaticConstraint creates a rigid joint between two `/Attachment`s. This joint allows the two Attachments to slide along one axis but does not allow any rotation. When a PrismaticConstraint is enabled, it constrains its Attachments so that the Attachments x-axes are collinear but pointing in opposite directions. It will also constrain the Attachments so their y-axes are parallel.

PrismaticConstraints can also be configured to actuate translation. If [SlidingBallConstraint.ActuatorType](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/SlidingBallConstraint/ActuatorType) is set to [Enum.ActuatorType/Motor](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=ActuatorType/Motor), then it will attempt to translate the attachments with the goal of reaching [SlidingBallConstraint.Velocity](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/SlidingBallConstraint/Velocity). This translation is limited by both [SlidingBallConstraint.MotorMaxAcceleration](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/SlidingBallConstraint/MotorMaxAcceleration) and [SlidingBallConstraint.MotorMaxForce](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/SlidingBallConstraint/MotorMaxForce).

If ActuatorType is set to [Enum.ActuatorType/Servo](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=ActuatorType/Servo), then the PrismaticConstraint will attempt to translate its Attachments to a set separation specified by [SlidingBallConstraint.TargetPosition](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/SlidingBallConstraint/TargetPosition). This translation is limited by both `Attachment` and `Attachment`.

Both actuated and free translation using a PrismaticConstraint can be limited by setting [SlidingBallConstraint.LimitsEnabled](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/SlidingBallConstraint/LimitsEnabled) to `true`.
