Terrain is a feature that allows players to create dynamically morphable environments, with little to no lag. Terrain is currently based on a 4x4x4 grid of cells, where each cell has a number between 0 and 1 representing how much the geometry should occupy the cell, and the material of the cell. The occupancy determines how the cell will morph together with surrounding cells, and the result is the illusion of having no grid constraint. Terrain provides a practically unlimited amount of space to work with.
