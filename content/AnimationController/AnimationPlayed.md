This event fires whenever the `AnimationController` begins playing an animation. It returns the `AnimationTrack` playing.

The `AnimationTrack` can be used to access the animation's playback functions and events. It will only fire for animations playing on the specific `AnimationController`.

See [Humanoid.AnimationPlayed](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/Humanoid/AnimationPlayed) for the `Humanoid` variant of this function.
