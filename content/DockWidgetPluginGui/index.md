**DockWidgetPluginGui** is a `PluginGui` that displays its contents inside a dockable Roblox Studio window. It is used to create widgets similar to the built-in **Animation Editor** and **Terrain Tools**.

This GUI can be created using [Plugin:CreateDockWidgetPluginGui()](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Plugin/CreateDockWidgetPluginGui).

See the [Building Studio Widgets](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=building%20studio%20widgets) tutorial for details on working with custom Studio widgets.
