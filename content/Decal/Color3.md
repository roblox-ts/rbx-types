The [DataType.Color3](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=Color3) tint of the `Decal`.

Developers should note that this property only sets the tint of the decal, rather than the color. This means, unless the image associated with the `Decal` was originally white (RGB = 1,1,1) then the color cannot be freely changed using this property.

By reducing the RGB properties of [DataType.Color3](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=Color3) in union, developers can make a decal darker.
