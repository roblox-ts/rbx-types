This sets whether or not the `Sound` repeats once it has finished when it is playing.

Looped sounds are suitable for a range of applications including music and background ambient sounds. The [Sound.DidLoop](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/Sound/DidLoop) event can be used to track the number of times as sound has looped.
