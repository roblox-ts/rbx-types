The ReverbSoundEffect simulates the effect of sounds bouncing off of several surfaces (such as walls in a room), which causes several overlapping echoes that arrive at the listener at slightly offset times.

Like all other `SoundEffect`, a ChorusSoundEffect can be applied either to a `Sound` or `SoundGroup` by being parented to either.
