BillboardGuis are containers for GUI objects that appear in the 3D space. A BillboardGui's position is determined by the position of it's [BillboardGui.Adornee](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BillboardGui/Adornee). If the adornee is set to `Part` then the [BasePart.Position](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BasePart/Position) will be used. If it is set to `Attachment` then the [Attachment.WorldPosition](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Attachment/WorldPosition) will be used. BillboardGui always faces the camera, and can change its size with distance or remain the same size on the screen. Unlike the text that appears above models with Humanoids' heads, this does not disappear with distance.
