This function returns an array containing all `Keyframe`s that have been added to a `KeyframeSequence`. This is functionally the same as using the [Instance.GetChildren](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Instance/GetChildren) function on the `KeyframeSequence`.

Note, this function will return all children of the `KeyframeSequence`, including non `Keyframe`s if any are present.
@returns An array of `Keyframe`s
