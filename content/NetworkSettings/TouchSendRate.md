TouchSendRate describes the rate per second in which `Touched` events are replicated back and forth between the server and the client. This includes both the [BasePart.Touched](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/BasePart/Touched) event, and the [BasePart.TouchEnded](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/BasePart/TouchEnded) event.
