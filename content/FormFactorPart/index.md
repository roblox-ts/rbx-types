The FormFactorPart class is an abstract class. It inherits from the `BasePart` class and adds the [FormFactorPart.FormFactor](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/FormFactorPart/FormFactor) property to classes that inherit from it.

The FormFactor property has been deprecated, so this class has been deprecated as well.
