A [DataType.CFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=CFrame) positioned at the [Workspace.CurrentCamera](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Workspace/CurrentCamera) and oriented toward the `Mouse`'s 3D position.

[Mouse.UnitRay](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Mouse/UnitRay) starts at the same position as Origin, and extends for a stud in the same direction.

```lua
local unitRay = mouse.UnitRay
local origin = mouse.Origin
-- unitRay.Direction = origin.p
-- unitRay.Direction ≈ origin.lookVector
```

For the position of the `Mouse` in 3D space, see [Mouse.Hit](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Mouse/Hit).
