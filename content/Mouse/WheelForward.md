Fires when the mouse wheel is scrolled forwards.

See [Mouse.WheelBackward](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/Mouse/WheelBackward) for the scrolling backwards event.

For information on how to obtain the `Mouse` object, please see the `Mouse` page.

Note, developers are recommended to use `UserInputService` instead of the `Mouse` object in new work.
