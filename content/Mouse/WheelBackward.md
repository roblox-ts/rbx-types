Fires when the mouse wheel is scrolled backwards.

See [Mouse.WheelForward](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/Mouse/WheelForward) for the scrolling forward event.

For information on how to obtain the `Mouse` object, please see the `Mouse` page.

Note, developers are recommended to use `UserInputService` instead of the `Mouse` object in new work.
