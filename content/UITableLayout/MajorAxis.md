MajorAxis determines whether sibling UI elements are treated as rows or columns. Below, the left uses a [Enum.TableMajorAxis](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=TableMajorAxis) of RowMajor, and the right uses ColumnMajor.

![Row major][1]![Column major][2]

**Note: it seems that this property isn't making noticeable changes, and rather its behavior is determined by [UIGridStyleLayout.FillDirection](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/UIGridStyleLayout/FillDirection) instead.**
