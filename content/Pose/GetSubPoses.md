This function returns an array containing all sub `Pose`s that have been added to a `Pose`. This is functionally the same as using the [Instance.GetChildren](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Instance/GetChildren) function on the `Pose`.

Note, this function will return all children of the `Pose`, including non `Pose` `Instance`s if any are present.
@returns An array of sub `Pose`s.
