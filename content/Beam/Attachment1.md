The `Attachment` the `Beam` ends at.

A `Beam`'s Attachment1 is the fourth and final control point on the `Beam`'s [cubic BÃ©zier curve][1]. The orientation of Attachment1, alongside the `Beam`'s [Beam.CurveSize1](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Beam/CurveSize1) property, determine the position of the third control point.

For the `Attachment` where the `Beam` starts see [Beam.Attachment0](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Beam/Attachment0).

For more information how a `Beam` curves, see [Beam.CurveSize1](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Beam/CurveSize1).
