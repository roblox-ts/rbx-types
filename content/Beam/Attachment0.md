The `Attachment` the `Beam` originates from.

A `Beam`'s Attachment0 is the first control point on the `Beam`'s [cubic BÃ©zier curve][1]. The orientation of Attachment0, alongside the `Beam`'s [Beam.CurveSize0](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Beam/CurveSize0), property determine the position of the second control point.

For the `Attachment` where the `Beam` ends see [Beam.Attachment1](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Beam/Attachment1).

For more information how a `Beam` curves, see [Beam.CurveSize0](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Beam/CurveSize0).
