The Emit method will cause the `ParticleEmitter` to emit the given number of particles similar to how [ParticleEmitter.Rate](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/Rate) does on [ParticleEmitter.Enalbed](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=Enalbed) emitters. Be warned - this always emits exactly the number of particles even if Roblox' graphics settings are lower. Emitting too many particles can cause performance issues on lower-end hardware.

To clear any emit particles, use [ParticleEmitter.Clear](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/ParticleEmitter/Clear).
@param particleCount The number of particles to emit
