![A visualization of how MaxSlopeAngle impacts characters walking on slanted surfaces.][1]

MaxSlopeAngle is a property of the Humanoid class, that determines the maximum slope angle that a humanoid can climb. If the angle of a slope is greater than a humanoid's MaxSlopeAngle, they will slide down the slope.

In the visualization above, the MaxSlopeAngle is shown above each character's head. As you can see, the character with a MaxSlopeAngle lower than the 45째 ramp ends up slipping into the lava.

The value of this property is constrained to values between 0째 and 89째. It defaults to 89째, so humanoids can climb pretty much any slope they want by default.
