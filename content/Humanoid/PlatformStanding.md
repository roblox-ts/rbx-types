This event fires when the `Humanoid` enters or leaves the *PlatformStanding* [Enum.HumanoidStateType](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=HumanoidStateType).

Whilst the `Humanoid` is in the *PlatformStanding* state, the [Humanoid.PlatformStand](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Humanoid/PlatformStand) property will be *true*.

Whilst [Humanoid.PlatformStand](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Humanoid/PlatformStand) is set to *true*, the `Humanoid` will be unable to move. For more information please see the page for [Humanoid.PlatformStand](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Humanoid/PlatformStand).

The PlatformStand [Enum.HumanoidStateType](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=HumanoidStateType) was associated with the now disabled `Platform` part. Despite this, it can still be used by developers.
