This event fires when the speed at which a `Humanoid` is swimming in `Terrain` water changes.

[Humanoids](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/Humanoid) swim at 87.5% of their [Humanoid.WalkSpeed](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Humanoid/WalkSpeed).

This event will not always fire with a speed of 0 when the `Humanoid` stops swimming.
