The MeshId is the content ID of the mesh that is to be displayed.

The content ID for a mesh is generated when a developer uploads a mesh to the Roblox website.

## How do I create a mesh?

Meshes can currently only be be uploaded using `MeshPart`s or the game explorer. Once uploaded however, the content ID for the mesh can be used for the MeshId property. For more information on how to do this please see [this tutorial](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=Mesh%20Parts).
