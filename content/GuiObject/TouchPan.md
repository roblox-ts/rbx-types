The TouchPan event fires when the player moves their finger on the UI element using a touch-enabled device. It fires shortly before [GuiObject.TouchSwipe](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/TouchSwipe) would, and does not fire with [GuiObject.TouchTap](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/TouchTap). This event is useful for allowing the player to manipulate the position of UI elements on the screen.

This event fires with a table of [DataType.Vector2](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=Vector2) that describe the relative screen positions of the fingers involved in the gesture. In addition, it fires several times with multiple [Enum.UserInputState](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=UserInputState)s: Begin after a brief delay, Change when the player moves their finger during the gesture and finally once more with End.

This event cannot be simulated in Studio using the emulator and a mouse; you must have a real touch enabled device to fire this event. Below is an animation of TouchPan firing on the black semitransparent `Frame` that covers the screen. The event is being used to manipulate the position of the pink inner `Frame`. The code for this can be found in the code samples.

This event is part of a family of touch-related events. Other events like this one are [GuiObject.TouchTap](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/TouchTap), [GuiObject.TouchRotate](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/TouchRotate), [GuiObject.TouchPinch](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/TouchPinch), [GuiObject.TouchLongPress](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/TouchLongPress) and [GuiObject.TouchSwipe](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/TouchSwipe).
