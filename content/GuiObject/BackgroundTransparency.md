This property determines the transparency of the [GUI's](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/GuiObject) background and border.

It does not, however, determine the transparency of text if the GUI is a `Textbox`, `TextButton`, or `TextLabel`. Text transparency is determined [TextBox.TextTransparency|](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=TextTransparency|), [TextButton.TextTransparency](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/TextButton/TextTransparency), and [TextLabel.TextTransparency](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/TextLabel/TextTransparency) respectively.

If the property is set to 1, neither the background nor the border will render and the GUI will be completely transparent.
