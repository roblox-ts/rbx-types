The TouchTap event fires when the player performs a tap gesture on the UI element using a touch-enabled device. A tap is a quick single touch without any movement involved (a longer press would fire [GuiObject.TouchLongPress](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/TouchLongPress), and moving during the touch would fire [GuiObject.TouchPan](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/TouchPan) and/or [GuiObject.TouchSwipe](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/TouchSwipe)). It fires with a table of [DataType.Vector2](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=Vector2)s that describe the relative positions of the fingers involved in the gesture.

Since this event only requires one finger, this event can be simulated in Studio using the emulator and a mouse. Below is an example of TouchTap being fired on a Frame that is [GuiObject.Active](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/GuiObject/Active). Below, the event fires when the cursor briefly pauses (to simulate a tap) and the Frame toggles its [GuiObject.BackgroundTransparency](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/GuiObject/BackgroundTransparency). The code for this can be found the code samples.

This event is part of a family of touch-related events. Other events like this one are [GuiObject.TouchSwipe](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/TouchSwipe), [GuiObject.TouchRotate](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/TouchRotate), [GuiObject.TouchPinch](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/TouchPinch), [GuiObject.TouchPan](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/TouchPan) and [Guiobject.TouchLongPress](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=TouchLongPress). In addition, `UserInputService` has a similarly named event that is not restricted to a specific UI element: [UserInputService.TouchSwipe](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/UserInputService/TouchSwipe).
