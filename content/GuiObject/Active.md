This property determines whether a `GuiObject` will sink input to 3D space, such as underlying models with a `ClickDetector`. In other words, if the player attempts to click a ClickDetector with the mouse hovering over an Active UI element, the UI will block the input from reaching the ClickDetector.

For `GuiButton` objects (`ImageButton` and `TextButton`), this property determines whether [GuiButton.Activated](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiButton/Activated) fires ([GuiButton.AutoButtonColor](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/GuiButton/AutoButtonColor) will still work for those as well). The events [InputBegan](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/InputBegan), [InputChanged](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/InputChanged), and [InputEnded](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/InputEnded) work as normal no matter the value of this property.
