The TouchPinch event fires when the player uses two fingers to make a pinch or pull gesture on the UI element using a touch-enabled device. A **pinch** happens when two or more fingers move closer together, and a **pull** happens when they move apart. This event fires in conjunction with [GuiObject.TouchPan](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/TouchPan). This event is useful for allowing the player to manipulate the scale (size) of UI elements on the screen, and is most often used for zooming features.

This event fires with a table of [DataType.Vector2](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=Vector2) that describe the relative screen positions of the fingers involved in the gesture. In addition, it fires several times with multiple [Enum.UserInputState](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=UserInputState)s: Begin after a brief delay, Change when the player moves a finger during the gesture and finally once more with End. It should be noted that the scale should be used **multiplicatively**.

Since this event requires at least two fingers, it is not possible to be simulated in Studio using the emulator and a mouse; you must have a real touch-enabled device (and also least two fingers, try asking a friend). Below is an animation of TouchPinch firing on the black semitransparent `Frame` that covers the screen (note the touch positions marked with white circles). The event is being used to manipulate the scale of the `TextLabel` that says "Hi!". The code for this can be found in the code samples.

This event is part of a family of touch-related events. Other events like this one are [GuiObject.TouchTap](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/TouchTap), [GuiObject.TouchRotate](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/TouchRotate), [GuiObject.TouchPan](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/TouchPan), [GuiObject.TouchLongPress](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/TouchLongPress) and [Guiobject.TouchSwipe](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=TouchSwipe). In addition, `UserInputService` has a similarly named event that is not restricted to a specific UI element: [UserInputService.TouchPinch](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/UserInputService/TouchPinch).
