A **RemoteFunction** is used to create in-game APIs that both the client and the server can use to communicate with each other. Like `BindableFunction`, a RemoteFunction can be invoked (called) to do a certain action and return the results.

If the result is **not** needed, we recommend that you use a `RemoteEvent` instead, since its call is asynchronous and doesn't need to wait for a response to continue execution. See `Remote Functions and Events` for more info.
