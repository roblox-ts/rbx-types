The Cancel function halts playback of its `Tween` and resets the tween variables. If [TweenBase.Play](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/TweenBase/Play) is called again the `Tween`'s properties will resume interpolating towards their destination but, as the tween variables have been reset, take the full length of the animation to do so.

Only the tween variables are reset, not the properties being changed by the tween. This means if you cancel a tween half way through its animation the properties will not reset to their original values. Where Cancel differs from [TweenBase.Pause](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/TweenBase/Pause) is that once resumed, it will take the full duration of the tween to complete the animation.
