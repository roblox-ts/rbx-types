A SurfaceLight is a light source that emits illumination of a specified [Light.Color](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Light/Color) and [Light.Brightness](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Light/Brightness) from a [SurfaceLight.Face](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/SurfaceLight/Face) for a specified [SurfaceLight.Range](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/SurfaceLight/Range).

In order for a SurfaceLight to provide illumination, it must be the direct child of a `BasePart` or `Attachment` (the part or attachment itself must be a descendant of the Workspace). If a SurfaceLight is parented to a part, then the light will emanate from the partâ€™s selected face(s). If parented to an attachment SurfaceLight is equivalent to a `SpotLight`.

For more light types, please see the **see also** section.
